Adjecent Node = COST Value
NON-Adjecent Node = 999 (Infinity)



/************ Steps To Follow ******************/

1) Enter The no. of vertices we have in our graph (Matrix in our case for Ease of Coding)

2) Then enter the Cost matrix along cost value of the node if its adjacent or 999 for viceversa.

3) Press Enter after cost matrix.

4) After then it initialize the Start Vertice of path.

5) Then the output will be print for each vertices along with minimum path and the minimum cost.
